# Rock-Paper-Scissor- games in C++

This game is a classic Rock–Paper–Scissors match where the player competes against the computer. The player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors, while the computer randomly selects its own option.


## 📄Description:

The program is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in C++ with 5 different player profiles. The user can select a profile to start the game. The selected player will play against the computer. In each round, the choices of the player and the computer are compared to determine the winner. At the end of the game, the player's score for each match is displayed and the results are announced.

## 💡 Key Concepts Used:

(i) Conditional Statements (if, else if, else) – to compare user and computer choices and decide the winner.

(ii) Random Number Generation (rand() in C/C++) – to let the computer make a random choice.

(iii) Loops (while or do-while) – to allow repeated gameplay until the user chooses to exit.

(iv) Input/Output (cin/cout in C++ or scanf/printf in C) – to get the user’s choice and display results.

(v) vData Types & Variables – to store user choice, computer choice, and game outcomes.

## ✨ Features:

* Play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer.

* User-friendly input for selecting Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

* Random computer choice for unpredictable gameplay.

* Automatic winner determination after each round.

* Option to play multiple rounds continuously.

* Displays both user and computer choices clearly.

* Can be implemented in both C++ and C languages.

* Simple and lightweight program suitable for beginners.

## 🔔 Purpose:

To provide an interactive way for users to play Rock-Paper-Scissors. To practice basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and input/output. To demonstrate random number generation in C/C++. To enhance problem-solving and logical thinking skills. To allow repeated gameplay with instant feedback. To show the implementation of simple game logic in programming. To create a fun and educational coding project for beginners.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced:

-> Conditional Statements (if, else if, else) for decision making.

-> Loops (while / do-while) for repeating gameplay.

-> Random Number Generation (rand()) for computer’s choice.

-> Input/Output Handling (cin/cout or scanf/printf).

-> Variables & Data Types to store choices and results.

-> Basic Game Logic for winner determination.

-> Code Structure & Organization for readable and maintainable programs.

## ▶️ How to Run:

1. Open your C/C++ IDE (like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Visual Studio).

2. Create a new project or file and paste the game code.

3. Compile the code to check for any errors.

4. Run the executable program.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

6. View the computer’s choice and the result of each round.

7. Choose whether to play again or exit the game.
